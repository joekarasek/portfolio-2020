  "description": "As a senior frontend developer and consultant, I was brought onto this project to help refactor and build out the theme for the City of Portland website. The City of Portland website is a massive domain, as it covers hundreds of departments, offices, advisory groups, project, and services. In addition to its massive scale, the City's website has spefic priorities to offer accessible, easy to navigate information and design. Creating a scalable, extendable, and maintainable theme for a website of this scale is a unique challenge, and I was brought on to provide expertise in creating such a system. In addition to extensive development and consultanting within the theming layer, I have also provided invaluable assistance in improving the performance of scripts, tooling, CI/CD, and docker configuration.",
