  "description": "I was brought on as a senior front-end consult and developer specifically tasked with helping to architect and build out the front-end of a JAM-stack based system. I provided valuable expertise and mentoring in both React and Gatsby as the in-house team got up-to-speed with these technologies. I also lead the effort to architect a highly scalable modular approach to theming for the site, including the setup of tooling to support the organization and maintainance of a modular UI system. Beyond helping with front-end developement and providing React expertise, I also helped integrate the front-end with various back-end services including Wordpress. Finally, I provided assistance in optimizing CI/CD, development workflows, and scaling of a static site build to enterprise level.",
