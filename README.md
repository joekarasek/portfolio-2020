## About

:tada: You've reached the portfolio of Joseph Karasek.

### Tech Stack

This site is put together using ReactJS and Gatsby. The data is mostly stored as json (because I love structured data, and someday I may migrate to a different system).

While did I pick these two technologies and not build something more custom? Because I'm familiar with them, they get the job done quickly, and lets be honest... maintaining a personal portfolio site takes time and effort and client work comes first.
